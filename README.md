# Smart Contract Dev Containers
This repository is for R&D purposes, currently focused on developing [Dev Containers](https://containers.dev/) for Smart Contract development on Polkadot.

### Quick Started
1. In your projects root directory, fetch our dev container environment:
```
curl -L --create-dirs \
     -o .devcontainer/devcontainer.json \
     https://raw.githubusercontent.com/charlesHetterich/scc-rnd/main/.devcontainer/devcontainer.json
```
2. VScode should prompt you to "Reopen in container". Do thisâ€”Make sure the "Dev Containers" plugin is installed

3. After the container loads, follow the startup instructions to load the generated Paseo address with faucet tokens.
